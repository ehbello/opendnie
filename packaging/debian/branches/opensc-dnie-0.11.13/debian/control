#Description: Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
# OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
# cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
# operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
# mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
# implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
# Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
# standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
# well.
# .
# Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
# /usr/share/doc/opensc/html/wiki/index.html - only some cards are
# supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
# card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
# operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
# require third party proprietary software.
